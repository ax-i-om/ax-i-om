  <summary><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;AI Disclosure</b></summary>
  <br>
  
I believe that disclosure of the use of artificial intelligence is extremely important to help mitigate any potential damages. Throughout my online presence, I leverage artificial intelligence to generate images that accompany the contents of my projects. For example, my profile picture here and on my personal website/blog were generated with artificial intelligence (specifically, OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E 2). I will disclose any other instances of my usage of artificial intelligence to generate such works in the scope of my projects and personal site/blog to the best of my ability. These disclosures can be found in the contents of the corresponding posts/projects.
